# Welcome

Welcome to my site hosted with GitHub Pages. I’m Ryan Renno, and this site is where I share ideas, projects, and experiments. Whether you just stumbled in or arrived on purpose, I hope you find something that peeks your interest.

## About Me

I’m a software engineer with a passion for clean code and interesting project hacks. This site is my playground for ideas—expect a mix of tech tutorials, random life hacks, and project updates.

## Posts

Here’s where I’ll be dropping my latest ramblings. Want to keep up? Subscribe via [RSS](#) (link coming soon—I’m still setting that up!). For now, check out these highlights:

- **[Scipture to Memory](#)**: A quick intro to scripture memorization!  *(Coming soon!)*
- **[Building a Blog in the GitHub Mobile App](#)**: Lessons learned after round one: this will save you time and money. *(Drafting this one.)*

## What’s Next?

I’m working on a few home projects that I may share, a blog series about my faith, and learning to use Jekyll. Stick around to see it unfold—or better yet, drop me a line if you’ve got ideas to share. Find me on X @ryanrenno.

Thanks for stopping by!
