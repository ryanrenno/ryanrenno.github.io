title: "Sermon Notes: Things Jesus Never Said - You do you - June 29, 2025"

On June 29, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the “Things Jesus Never Said” series. This week: phrases like “You do you,” “Live your truth,” “If it makes you happy,” and “Follow your heart.” They sound good, but Jesus never said them—in fact, He said the opposite. Tied to United’s mission of helping people know and follow Jesus, this message dug into scripture to redefine happiness and holiness. Here’s what I took away.

### Phrases Jesus Never Said

The pastor started with a question: Have you ever stopped to think if Jesus actually said these catchy lines? “You do you” and “Follow your heart” push personal freedom, but Jesus calls us to a higher standard. Take John 8:2-11—Jesus forgives the woman caught in adultery, but adds, “Go and sin no more.” It’s not about doing what feels right; it’s about turning from sin and walking toward God. No eternal life without that turn, He says.

Jesus was stricter than Moses. Moses said don’t commit adultery (Exodus 20:14); Jesus said if you even look with lust, you’ve sinned in your heart (Matthew 5:28). The pastor used a driving example: I might judge someone texting while driving, but if I read a text myself, I’m just as guilty. It’s a wake-up call—holiness isn’t optional.

### Happiness vs. Holiness

The idea of chasing happiness as our main goal backfires when trials hit. The pastor pointed to King Solomon in Ecclesiastes 2:1-11. He tested pleasure with wealth, projects, wine, and concubines, saying, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure.” But by verse 11, he called it “vanity and a striving after wind”—nothing gained. Ecclesiastes 3:11 notes eternity is in our hearts, a longing only Jesus can fill, since He hadn’t come in Solomon’s time. Solomon’s conclusion in 12:13? “Fear God and keep His commandments.”

Psalm 16:11 promises “fullness of joy” in God’s presence, and Psalm 37:4 says, “Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart.” Happiness and holiness aren’t at odds—chasing false gods like pleasure or money leads to emptiness, but God satisfies.

### Six Words to True Happiness

The pastor boiled it down to six words from Jesus’ teaching:
- **Repent**: Turn from sin.
- **Receive Jesus**: Accept His forgiveness.
- **Reborn**: Start anew in Him.
- **Renew your mind**: Align thoughts with God (Romans 12:2).
- **Rebuke the enemy**: Stand against temptation.
- **Rebuild your life around Jesus**: Center everything on Him.

This flips “If it makes you happy.” True joy comes from following Jesus, not our hearts, which can lead us astray (Jeremiah 17:9).

### My Takeaway

This one hit me. I’ve caught myself living by “do what feels good,” especially when stressed, but Solomon’s story shows it’s a dead end. For me, it’s about repenting daily and rebuilding my focus on Jesus—maybe starting with prayer over scrolling. I’m challenged to see happiness as a byproduct of holiness, not the goal.
