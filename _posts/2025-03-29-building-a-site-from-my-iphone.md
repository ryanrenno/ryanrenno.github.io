title: "Building a Website from My iPhone with GitHub Pages and Jekyll"

I built this website using only my iPhone, and it’s live at [ryanrenno.github.io](https://ryanrenno.github.io)! Here’s how I did it with GitHub Pages and Jekyll—no computer needed.

### Step 1: GitHub Setup
I signed up at [github.com](https://github.com) and created a repository called `ryanrenno.github.io`. Keeping it public is key for GitHub Pages. You also have to name the repository the same name as your username.

### Step 2: Adding Jekyll Files
Using the Safari browser on my phone I navigated to the ryanrenno GitHub repo. I used “Create new file” to add:
- `_config.yml`: Set up my site title and theme (I used `minima`).
- `index.md`: My homepage with a simple “Hello, world!”.

### Step 3: Going Live
In the repo’s Settings > Pages, I set the source to the `main` branch. After a few minutes, my site was up!

### What I Learned
- You don’t need fancy tools—just a browser and patience.
- Editing on GitHub’s site is free and easy.
- Next time, I might explore themes or add more posts like this.

If you’ve got an iPhone and want a site, try it out! Questions? Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno].
