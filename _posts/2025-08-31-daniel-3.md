title: "Sermon Notes: Daniel 3 - Passing Through the Fire of Babylon - August 31, 2025"

On August 31, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor kicked off a new study with Daniel 3. Babylon, a symbol of human pride and idolatry in Revelation, clashes with our faith today. What’s our modern Babylon? Tied to United’s mission of helping people know and follow Jesus, this message hit with bold lessons from the fiery furnace. Here’s what I took away.

### Standing Firm in the Fire

In Daniel 3, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego faced a furnace for refusing to bow to Nebuchadnezzar’s idol. They didn’t hide their Jewish faith, even in public roles, and shared it boldly when death loomed. The king’s hatred led to others dying in the pursuit, showing collateral damage from sin. The pastor asked: When you read this, do you jump to talk or pause to think, “What would I do?” If someone threatened you or your kids, would you deny Jesus—or trust the outcome? Their clothes stayed unsinged, not a hair burned, no smoke smell (Daniel 3:27). Our testimony proves God’s reality; they can’t deny your connection with Christ.

### Four Key Points

1. **Expect the Fire**: 1 Peter 4:12 says, “Do not be surprised at the fiery trial.” It’ll feel hot, but trust God. His power guards you through faith.
2. **Don’t Hide Your Faith**: Be bold—confidence in the right God stuns a sin-warped world, like the Matrix needing a faith that astounds.
3. **Mind the Collateral**: Others turn from Jesus because of Christians’ actions—let’s not push people away.
4. **Jesus Is With You**: God was in the fire, protecting and glorifying Himself. Sometimes we miss Him expecting something else, but He’s enough.

### Living in Babylon

We live in a Babylon where some fume at our refusal to assimilate—expect cancellation or mockery. Yet, like the three, faith in God prevails. The pastor ended with a prayer: “Thank you, Jesus, for being the same; give me power to live faithfully for You.”

### My Takeaway

This one hit deep. I’ve wondered if I’d stand firm under pressure, and Babylon’s pull—social media, trends—feels real. For me, it’s being bolder, maybe sharing faith at work, and trusting Jesus in the heat. The question lingers: Would I hold fast?
