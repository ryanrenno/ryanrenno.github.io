title: "Sermon Notes: Jonah Week Four Chapter 4 - August 24, 2025"

On August 24, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor wrapped up the Jonah series with Chapter 4. We started with Jerry, exceedingly glad today—new inheritance, another grandchild, benching 225, even a root canal! But Jonah? Not so much. Tied to United’s mission of helping people know and follow Jesus, this message dug into mercy, hypocrisy, and God’s chase. Here’s what I took away.

### Jonah’s Missed Mercy

Jonah should’ve celebrated God’s work in his life and Israel’s, extending it to Nineveh. Instead, he fumed when his short sermon—“You are doomed, peace” (Jonah 3:4)—turned the city, even their animals, to God, and mercy spared them. In Chapter 4, he’s mad God relented. We learn why he ran: he knew God’s grace and didn’t want “those” people—Nineveh’s brutal Assyrians (modern Iraq)—to share it. He loved mercy for himself but not for them. Who are “those” in your life—bad parents, a friend you’re glad to see stumble?

### A Depressed Prophet

Jonah 4:3 shows him depressed, asking God to kill him, blind to the irony—he’d face God immediately. The pastor said we demand things of others or God we don’t demand of ourselves: “God should’ve given me a good dad,” “a spouse by now,” “perfect kids,” or “more friends.” Truth bomb: Life’s ups and downs are worth living because Jesus is. That song “Life Worth Living” echoes—live for Him, and one day hear, “Well done, my faithful servant.”

God probes our hearts (Psalm 139:23), asking questions He knows the answers to (Jonah 4:4), but we often push the Holy Spirit away. Jonah cared more about a plant’s shade than God’s mercy to Nineveh, loving creation over the Creator—security, health, money over Jesus.

### God’s Relentless Pursuit

Jonah’s joy fades back to depression (Jonah 4:9), missing God’s lesson. The pastor said we’re Jonah, running, seeking comfort in entertainment or addiction, not prayer. We like Jesus as Savior but resist Him as Lord. Yet God chases, loving Jonah—and us—wanting reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18-19). No one’s too far gone; if Nineveh wasn’t, neither are you. God’s after you now.

### My Takeaway

This one hit hard. I’ve held grudges, glad for others’ stumbles, and chased comfort over God. Jonah’s plant obsession mirrors my distractions. For me, it’s praying to see my sin and share mercy. The question lingers: Who are my “Ninevites”?

What about you? Who are “those” people for you? Where’s God chasing you now? Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno](https://x.com/ryanrenno). This series keeps reshaping me—more to come!
