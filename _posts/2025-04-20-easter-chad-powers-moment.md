Easter Sunday, April 20, 2025, had me glued to my iPhone, jotting notes as the pastor unpacked Luke 24 and the resurrection. He kicked things off with a wild analogy: Eli Manning’s Chad Powers moment. You know, when Manning went undercover as “Chad Powers” for a Penn State football tryout, then revealed his true skills? Jesus had His own Chad Powers moment on that first Easter—showing up incognito, then blowing everyone’s minds as the risen Son of God. Here’s why it’s a game-changer.

### The Road to Emmaus: Jesus, Unrecognized

Luke 24:13-35 sets the scene. Two disciples are walking to Emmaus, heads down, hearts heavy. They’re talking about Jesus’ crucifixion, unaware the guy joining them *is* Jesus. The pastor said He was probably unrecognizable because of how brutally He was beaten before the cross. They spill the tea: “You haven’t heard? Jesus of Nazareth, a mighty prophet, was crucified and killed!” They knew His name, His hometown, His power—but they missed the part where He’d rise.

Jesus plays it cool, asking, “What things?” as they recap the weekend’s drama. Then He flips the script, explaining how the Old Testament pointed to Him all along. Talk about a mic-drop moment waiting to happen.

### Old Testament Clues: The Messiah Named Yeshua

The pastor dove into prophecies. Isaiah 11:2 calls the Messiah a “Branch” (in Hebrew, *Netzer*, tied to *Yeshua*—Jesus’ name literally screams “Messiah”). Isaiah 35 promises the blind will see, the deaf will hear, the mute will speak—check, Jesus did that. Isaiah 53 hits harder: He’d be oppressed, silent before His accusers, buried with the wicked, crushed by God’s will. Why? Verses 4-6: “He took up our pain and bore our suffering… the punishment that brought us peace was on Him.” All our screw-ups, like sheep gone astray, were laid on Him. Jesus paid it all.

### The Big Reveal: He’s Alive!

Back on the road, the disciples’ eyes finally open—they recognize Jesus, and He vanishes. They sprint back to Jerusalem, shouting, “It’s true! The Lord has risen and appeared to Simon!” (verse 34). It’s pure Chad Powers energy: the crowd’s buzzing, and Jesus reveals He’s not just a prophet—He’s the Son of God, alive forever.

### Why It Matters to Me

So, why does Easter matter? It’s not just a cool story. Jesus took my sin—my mess, my guilt—and bore the punishment I deserved. That’s the deal that brings peace, the kind no job or bank account can touch. I’m still learning to lean into that. Like those disciples, I can miss Jesus right in front of me, stuck on my own sadness or plans. But He’s risen, and that changes everything.

The pastor left us with this: Easter’s proof God’s not done with us. What’s holding you back from trusting Him? For me, it’s letting go of control and believing He’s got me. I’m thankful for that cross and empty tomb—they’re my Chad Powers moment too.
