Today, April 13, 2025, I sat in church for Palm Sunday, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor unpacked Luke 19:28-48. The big question: Why does Palm Sunday matter to my life? The answer boiled down to one word—peace. Not the fleeting kind, but the deep, soul-level peace Jesus brings. Here’s what hit me.

### Jesus Enters as King

The story starts with Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a young donkey (Luke 19:28-35). The pastor pointed to Zechariah 9:9, written centuries earlier: “Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey.” By choosing a donkey, not a warhorse, Jesus fulfills this prophecy and makes a statement. In that culture, kings rode horses to flex victory after war; donkeys signaled peace. Jesus is saying, “I’m your King, and I bring peace.”

The crowds get it—they’re waving palm branches, shouting, “Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!” (verse 38). Luke’s gospel connects these Old Testament dots to show Jesus as the real deal. He’s not just a teacher; He’s the King of the world, offering true peace to anyone who accepts Him as Lord.

### Peace Amid Turmoil

But it’s not all cheers. Jesus weeps over Jerusalem (verses 41-44), predicting enemies will crush it—men, women, children—because they missed “the things that make for peace.” Decades later, in 70 AD, Rome did just that. The pastor said Jerusalem’s nickname, “foundation of peace,” feels ironic without Jesus. Even when life looks calm, there’s unrest in our souls without His love. He kills hostility—between us and God, us and others—and replaces it with peace.

### Where Do I Find Peace?

This got personal. The pastor asked, “What gives you peace?” I chase it in job security, financial stability, balancing family life. When trials hit, my gut is to hustle harder, not pray first. But Jesus offers peace that doesn’t crash when life does. Believing in Him, leaning on Him—that’s the real deal. I need to make dependency on Jesus my first response, not my backup plan.

He called us God’s new temple, our bodies meant for worship, not sin. Like Jesus clearing the temple (verses 45-46), we’ve got to purge our “peace substitutes”—money, status, relationships, work. I’m guilty of leaning on those too.

### Confession and the Cross

Here’s where it clicked: peace comes through confession. James 5:16 says, “Confess your sins to one another and pray for each other so that you may be healed.” 1 John 1:9 adds, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive.” Sharing my mess with trusted people isn’t weakness—it’s freedom. Confession empties the junk and fills me with God’s peace, an anxiety-free life He wants for us.

And Palm Sunday points to the cross. Jesus rode in knowing He’d sacrifice Himself to pay for our sin. That free, perfect gift—His life for mine—blows me away. It’s why I can have peace, no matter what.

### What’s Your Peace Substitute?

So, what’s mine? Work and control, for sure. What about you? The pastor’s question lingers: What are you chasing instead of Jesus? Palm Sunday’s a reminder—He’s the King who brings peace, not chaos. I’m thankful for that, and I’m chewing on how to live it out.
