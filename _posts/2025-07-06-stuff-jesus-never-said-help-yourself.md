title: "Sermon Notes: Things Jesus Never Said - Some Phrases - July 6, 2025"

On July 6, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the “Things Jesus Never Said” series. This week: “God helps those who help themselves.” It’s a popular saying, but did Jesus say it? Nope. Tied to United’s mission of helping people know and follow Jesus, this message unpacked what’s true, what’s off, and what God really calls us to. Here’s what I took away.

### The Truth and Lie in the Phrase

The pastor started with a question: Is there any truth in “God helps those who help themselves”? Yes, partly. The Bible commends hard work—Proverbs 12:11 says, “Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread,” and 2 Thessalonians 3:10 adds, “If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.” Laziness isn’t the vibe. But the flip side? We’re called to trust God with what only He can do and do what He’s already told us—like loving others or sharing our faith. 1 Peter 3:15 says, “In your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense… with gentleness and respect.” It’s a balance, not self-reliance.

### God Helps the Helpless

Here’s the kicker: God doesn’t wait for us to fix ourselves. Romans 5:6-11 shows the paradox—while we were still weak and enemies, Christ died for us (v. 10). God helps those who know they can’t help themselves. The pastor stressed: we have the Holy Spirit to convict us, not guilt trips from others. Only Jesus can fix us. Pride blocks that grace—James 4:6 says, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” We can’t save anyone; only God can. Our job? Share our testimony, as 1 Peter 3:15 encourages, and leave the rest to Him.

### Faithfulness in Every Area

The pastor tied this to daily life. 1 Corinthians 4:1-2 calls us stewards who must be found faithful, and Colossians 3:23 says, “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord.” That applies to relationships, school, job, spouse, and spiritual disciplines. 2 Peter 1:3-7 promises God’s power gives us everything for life and godliness, urging us to grow in faith, virtue, and love. The call? Be faithful, not perfect.

### My Takeaway

This one stuck with me. I’ve leaned on “help yourself” when pushing through work or tough talks, but it’s humbling to admit I need Jesus. For me, it’s being faithful in small things—like praying daily or sharing hope gently with a friend. The pastor’s question lingers: Am I being faithful?

What about you? Ever relied on this phrase when life got hard? How’s God calling you to trust Him more? Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno](https://x.com/ryanrenno). This series keeps challenging me—more to come!
