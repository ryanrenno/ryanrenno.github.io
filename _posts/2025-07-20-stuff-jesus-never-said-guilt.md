title: "Sermon Notes: Things Jesus Never Said - Guilt - July 20, 2025"

On July 20, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the “Things Jesus Never Said” series. This week: “You get what you deserve.” We all feel guilt—over ice cream, sure, but also relationships or spiritual failures. Tied to United’s mission of helping people know and follow Jesus, this message unpacked Jesus’ grace on the cross and a forgotten practice. Here’s what I took away.

### The Cross and Grace

The pastor took us to Luke 23:32-43, where Jesus hangs between two criminals. Crucifixion was brutal—“excruciating” literally means “out of the cross.” It could take four days, with death by asphyxiation as victims struggled to breathe. Yet Jesus prays, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do” (v. 34), even as soldiers cast lots for His clothes and taunted Him. Could we pray that? One criminal admits his guilt, saying they deserve their fate, while the other mocks, “Save yourself and us.” Jesus replies, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise” (v. 43)—not just withholding deserved punishment, but offering grace.

### Beyond What We Deserve

We finish phrases like “What goes around…,” “Your past will…,” “If you make your bed, you got to…,” or “Play stupid games…” with ideas of payback. But Jesus flips it. The parable of the laborers in Matthew 20:15 shows a landowner paying all workers equally, asking, “Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me?” Jesus doesn’t give us what we deserve. Romans 3:23 says, “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” and 3:20 adds the law can’t justify us—only grace can. That criminal feared God, admitted his unworthiness, and asked for mercy—Jesus gave him paradise.

### Confession as Freedom

The pastor highlighted a missed practice: confession. Not a priest in a booth, but as in Acts 19:18, where believers confessed publicly, or James 5:16, “Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another.” 1 John 1:9 promises, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us.” Biblical confession involves others—it’s a pathway out of guilt. Why don’t we do this? The pastor challenged us: Pray, and ask, who can I share my struggles with?

### My Takeaway

This one hit deep. I’ve carried guilt, thinking I deserve the weight, but Jesus’ words to that criminal shift everything. For me, it’s confessing to a trusted friend—maybe starting with a prayer to find that person. The pastor’s challenge sticks: Who’s that someone?
