title: "Sermon Notes: Weird Stuff Christians Do - Prayer - May 18, 2025"

On May 18, 2025, I was back in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the “Weird Stuff Christians Do” series. This week: prayer, specifically corporate prayer—when we pray together as a church. Why does it feel weird to some, and why’s it so powerful? Acts 12:1-17 shows God moving in wild ways, even when the pray-ers are shocked by the answer. Here’s what hit me.

### The Power of Corporate Prayer

Acts 12:1-17 tells a crazy story. King Herod jails Peter, planning to execute him. The church prays fervently, and an angel busts Peter out—chains fall, gates open, he’s free. When he shows up at the prayer meeting, the folks praying are floored, thinking he’s a ghost (verse 15). They’re praying hard but surprised God answered so fast. The pastor said when we’re in Christ, God’s ear is tuned to us. Corporate prayer—lifting our voices together—has power.

### Why God Might Say “No”

But what about when prayers don’t get a “yes”? The pastor laid out three reasons:
1. **God’s a Good Father**: Like any loving parent, He does what’s best for us, not always what we want.
2. **We Don’t Get the Full Picture**: God’s working on levels we can’t see. His plan’s bigger than our requests.
3. **We’re Not Persistent**: Acts 12 says the church prayed “earnestly.” Are we diligently asking, or giving up too soon?

This made me think. I pray, but do I keep at it? And do I join others in prayer, or just go solo?

### What Are We Praying For?

The pastor got practical, asking if we’re praying together for stuff like:
- Growing in godliness and character.
- Breaking free from sin patterns.
- Boldness to share Jesus with others.
- Healing broken relationships, finding a spouse, or blessing our kids.
- Help with school, work, or health.

I’m challenged here. I want to share my faith, but I don’t always pray for boldness. And I lean on solo prayers when praying with others could spark something bigger.

### Prayer as a First Instinct

The pastor’s final question hit hard: Are we willing to make corporate prayer our first instinct, not a last resort? In Acts, the church didn’t wait for Peter’s execution—they prayed, and God moved. I want that kind of faith in my church and my life. Prayer’s not just “weird Christian stuff”; it’s how we lean into God together.

What about you? Are you praying with others, or does it feel awkward? What’s one thing you could bring to a prayer group? Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno](https://x.com/ryanrenno). This series is pushing me to rethink how I follow Jesus—more to come!
