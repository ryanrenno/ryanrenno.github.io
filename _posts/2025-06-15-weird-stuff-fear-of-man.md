title: "Sermon Notes: Weird Stuff Christians Do - Fear of Man - June 15, 2025"

On June 15, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the “Weird Stuff Christians Do” series. This week: fear of man. Not just being scared of people, but caring too much about their opinions—letting them control or define us. It’s why we hesitate to sing, get baptized, or pray with others. Drawing from 1 Samuel and Ed Welch’s wisdom, the pastor showed how fear of man shrinks God in our hearts. Here’s what hit me.

### Fear of Man: When People Are Big

Ed Welch defines “fear” biblically as more than being afraid—it’s holding people in awe, trusting them over God, even worshipping their approval. The pastor pointed to King Saul in 1 Samuel. In 15:24, Saul admits he sinned because he “feared the people” more than God. In 18:6-16, he’s jealous of David’s popularity, letting fear fester into rage. By 24:6, David shows the opposite—sparing Saul out of reverence for God, not man. Saul’s fear of people led to his downfall, and it can trip us up too.

This fear shows up in “weird” Christian stuff. Ever hold back from singing loud because you’re worried about looking silly? Skip baptism because of what friends might think? Hesitate to pray with others or show hospitality to strangers? I’m guilty. I’ve stayed quiet in a group, scared of sounding dumb, when I could’ve prayed for someone.

### The Seesaw: Fear God, Not Man

The pastor used a seesaw analogy: when people are big in our hearts, God gets small. When we fear God—holding Him in awe—people’s opinions lose their grip. 1 John 4:20 says, “If anyone says, ‘I love God,’ yet hates his brother, he is a liar.” Loving God and people goes together, but we can’t worship both. Ed Welch nails it: “Whenever people are big, God is not.” The antidote to fear of man is fearing the Lord—seeing Him as awesome and glorious.

### Being Weird for Jesus

This got personal. I sometimes clam up during worship or dodge praying with others, worried about looking “weird.” But the pastor flipped it: What did Jesus do? He embraced the cross, looking foolish to the world, for us. If He can be “weird” for me, I can risk it for Him. Singing off-key, getting dunked in baptism, or hosting a stranger—it’s all worship when it’s for God.

The pastor’s challenge: Are you willing to be weird for Jesus? For me, it’s praying for someone on the spot, even if my voice shakes. It’s choosing God’s approval over the crowd’s.
