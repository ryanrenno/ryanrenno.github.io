title: "Sermon Notes: Things Jesus Never Said - More than you can handle - June 22, 2025"

On June 22, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor kicked off a new series: “Things Jesus Never Said.” This week’s focus? The popular line, “God will never give you more than you can handle.” It’s meant to encourage, but did Jesus actually say it? Spoiler: no. Tied to United’s mission—helping people know and follow Jesus—this message dug into scripture to flip that idea on its head. Here’s what I took away.

### A Phrase Jesus Never Said

We toss around sayings like “God helps those who help themselves” or “God wants you to be happy,” but the pastor asked: Did Jesus say them? Nope. The big one today: “God will never give you more than you can handle.” It sounds comforting, but it doesn’t hold up. Look at Moses—leading a grumbling nation through the desert (Exodus 5-14). Job—losing everything, wrestling with despair (Job 1-2). David in Psalm 38, crying out in pain and guilt: “I am feeble and utterly crushed” (v. 8). These folks faced more than they could handle.

### Jesus’ Own Struggle

Jesus Himself proves this. In John 16:33, He says, “Take heart, I have overcome the world,” but His life wasn’t easy. He sweat blood in Gethsemane, asking God if there was another way (Luke 22:44). On the cross, He cried, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46). Jesus took on more than He could handle—our sin—for us. The pastor said this shows God’s love and forgiveness come through Jesus, who earned our salvation. Admitting we’ve sinned and need Him is the starting point.

### Paul’s Thorn and God’s Grace

Then there’s Paul in 2 Corinthians 12:7-10. He had a “thorn in the flesh”—some struggle he begged God to remove. God’s answer? “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (v. 9). Paul admits, “I am not okay.” The pastor emphasized: we can own our limits, confess our weaknesses, and admit we can’t handle it all. That’s where God’s power shines. Boasting in our weakness invites His presence, especially in tough seasons.

### What About Our Thorns?

The pastor got real: if you walk with God, your “thorn” moment will come—dark depression, a broken marriage, health issues, kids straying. Prayers for healing don’t always remove the thorn, like with Paul. But God’s grace sustains us. The challenge? Be faithful, lean into His presence, and let His power carry you when life overwhelms.

### My Takeaway

This hit home. I’ve clung to “more than you can handle” as a lifeline, but Jesus’ suffering and Paul’s thorn show it’s okay to break and need help. For me, it’s admitting when I’m overwhelmed—maybe with work or doubt—and trusting God’s grace. I’m praying for that shift, knowing He’s enough.

What about you? Ever leaned on that phrase when life got heavy? How’s God’s grace showing up in your weakness? Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno](https://x.com/ryanrenno). This new series is already stretching me—more to come!
