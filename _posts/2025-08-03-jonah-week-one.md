title: "Sermon Notes: Jonah - August 3, 2025"

On August 3, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor explored the book of Jonah. Nineveh was a city steeped in corruption and sin, and Jonah despised the Ninevites. This story isn’t just about a prophet and a fish—it’s about running from God and His relentless pursuit. Tied to United’s mission of helping people know and follow Jesus, it hit with some hard reflections. Here’s what I took away.

### Reflection #1: Running Takes Us Down

The pastor kicked off with this: When we run from God, we go down. Jonah fled from God’s call to Nineveh, and it cost him. You’re going down when you do what you shouldn’t—like losing your temper—or skip what you should, like helping someone in need. Yet even as Jonah bolts, God chases him, sending a storm to get his attention. It’s a reminder: disobedience drags us low, but God doesn’t let go.

### Reflection #2: Life Hits the Fan

Running from God doesn’t just affect us—it ripples out. The storm endangered the pagan sailors on Jonah’s ship. The pastor said God’s discipline comes from love, not anger, to draw us back. Jonah’s defiance put others at risk, showing how our choices can mess with those around us. It’s a wake-up call to face God’s call head-on.

### Reflection #3: The Hypocrisy Check

Jonah had the religious talk down—enough to seem God-fearing—but his heart wasn’t in it. When the sailors asked who he was, his hypocrisy showed—he ran from the God he claimed to serve. The pastor got real: We might not binge-watch, rage-scroll, or snap at a barista over skim milk, but are we any different? In Jonah 1, the pagan sailors end up fearing God and making vows, while Jonah’s heart stays unchanged. It’s a mirror moment.

### God’s Pursuit and the Gospel

In Jonah 2:1, God rescues Jonah from the fish’s belly, pointing to Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection—the ultimate rescue. The pastor said this story echoes the gospel: God pursues everyone, even the reluctant and the lost, to bring them to repentance. Nineveh’s eventual turn, and even the sailors’ response, show His reach.

### My Takeaway

This one hit deep. I’ve run from hard calls—avoiding tough conversations or cutting corners—thinking I can hide. But God’s pursuit, even through discipline, shows His love. For me, it’s facing one of those “shoulds” this week, maybe with a prayer for strength. The mirror of Jonah’s hypocrisy stings—am I real with God?
