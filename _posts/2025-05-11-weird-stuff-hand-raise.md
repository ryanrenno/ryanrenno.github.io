title: "Sermon Notes: Weird Stuff Christians Do - Hand Raising - May 11, 2025"

Last Sunday, May 11, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the “Weird Stuff Christians Do” series. This time: hand raising. Why do some folks think it’s weird to cheer, lift hands, or shout in worship, but go wild at a sports game? From King David’s dancing to the Psalms’ calls to shout, the Bible says expressive worship isn’t weird—it’s wired into praising God. Here’s what I took away.

### King David’s Dance Party

The pastor started with 2 Samuel 6:16-24. King David’s bringing the Ark of God back, and he’s *all in*—leaping, dancing, praising the Lord with everything he’s got. His wife, Michal, sees this and despises him, thinking he’s undignified. David’s response? “I’ll get even more undignified for God!” He’s not embarrassed; he’s worshipping the Creator. The pastor asked: Why do we cheer louder for our kid’s Little League team than for the One who made the universe?

### The Bible’s Call to Get Loud

Scripture backs this up. Psalm 66:1 says, “Shout for joy to God, all the earth!” Psalm 47:1 adds, “Clap your hands, all you nations; shout to God with cries of joy.” The pastor noted Psalms mentions singing 126 times and shouting 18 times—God’s people aren’t shy. Then there’s Psalm 95:6: “Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.” Worship can mean shouting, clapping, or bowing—it’s all about the heart.

Isaiah 6:1-7 hit me hard. Isaiah sees God’s holiness, and he’s undone—humbled, broken, ready to serve. The pastor said singing and raising hands can do that to us: meeting a holy God leaves us bowing, crying, or lifting our hands in awe.

### Heart Posture Over Hand Posture

The real question isn’t “Are you raising your hands?” but “Is your heart bowing before God?” The pastor pointed out we’ll scream for a touchdown but stay stiff in church. I’m guilty—my hands stay in my pockets sometimes, worried what people think. But worship isn’t about looking cool; it’s about giving God the honor He deserves. Raising hands, shouting, or even dancing like David—it’s saying, “God, You’re worth it.”

### My Takeaway

This made me rethink worship. I cheer like crazy when my boys make amazing plays on the baseball diamond but I don't behave this way in church. Why? Maybe I’m scared of looking “weird.” But if David can dance before God, I can lift a hand or two. It’s not about the motion—it’s about my heart saying yes to Jesus.

What about you? Do you go all-in during worship, or does it feel awkward? Let’s talk about it on [X @ryanrenno](https://x.com/ryanrenno). This series is challenging me to rethink what it means to follow Jesus—stay tuned for more.
