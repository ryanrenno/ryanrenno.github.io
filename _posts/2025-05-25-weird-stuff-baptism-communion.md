On May 25, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the “Weird Stuff Christians Do” series. This week: baptism and communion. These acts can feel strange to outsiders—or even to us—but they’re at the heart of following Jesus. From Matthew 28 to Acts, the Bible shows they’re not just rituals; they’re powerful steps of faith. Here’s what I took away.

### Baptism: Dunked Into New Life

Jesus kicks off the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19, telling His disciples to “make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” It’s priority one. Acts doubles down—Peter in Acts 2:38 says, “Repent and be baptized,” and we see it again and again: Philip baptizing new believers (Acts 8:12-13, 35-38), Paul getting baptized (Acts 9:18), Cornelius’ household (Acts 10:47-48), Lydia (Acts 16:14-15), and more (Acts 18:8, 19:5-6). Baptism was *the* first step for early Christians.

The word “baptism” means to dip, dunk, or immerse—think plunging into water, not just a sprinkle. Colossians 2:12 says it’s like being “buried with Him in baptism and raised with Him through faith.” It’s a public declaration: I’m in Christ, forgiven, free. The pastor said watching a baptism should remind us of that freedom. But Matthew 28:17 hit me—some disciples doubted, even seeing Jesus. If doubts hold you back from baptism, talk them out with someone. I’m chewing on that myself.

### Communion: A Meal That Reminds Us

Then there’s communion, from Matthew 26:26-28 and 1 Corinthians 11:17-34
