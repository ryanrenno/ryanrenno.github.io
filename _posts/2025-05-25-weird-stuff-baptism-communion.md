title: "Sermon Notes: Weird Stuff Christians Do - Baptism and Communion - May 25, 2025"

On May 25, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the “Weird Stuff Christians Do” series. This week: baptism and communion. These acts can feel strange to outsiders—or even to us—but they’re at the heart of following Jesus. From Matthew 28 to Acts, the Bible shows they’re not just rituals; they’re powerful steps of faith. Here’s what I took away.

### Baptism: Dunked Into New Life

Jesus kicks off the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19, telling His disciples to “make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” It’s priority one. Acts doubles down—Peter in Acts 2:38 says, “Repent and be baptized,” and we see it again and again: Philip baptizing new believers (Acts 8:12-13, 35-38), Paul getting baptized (Acts 9:18), Cornelius’ household (Acts 10:47-48), Lydia (Acts 16:14-15), and more (Acts 18:8, 19:5-6). Baptism was *the* first step for early Christians.

The word “baptism” means to dip, dunk, or immerse—think plunging into water, not just a sprinkle. Colossians 2:12 says it’s like being “buried with Him in baptism and raised with Him through faith.” It’s a public declaration: I’m in Christ, forgiven, free. The pastor said watching a baptism should remind us of that freedom. But Matthew 28:17 hit me—some disciples doubted, even seeing Jesus. If doubts hold you back from baptism, talk them out with someone. I’m chewing on that myself.

### Communion: A Meal That Reminds Us

Then there’s communion, from Matthew 26:26-28 and 1 Corinthians 11:17-34. Jesus took bread and wine, saying, “This is my body… my blood, poured out for the forgiveness of sins.” The pastor listed what communion does:
- Reminds us Jesus died in our place.
- Nourishes us spiritually.
- Unites believers as one body.
- Affirms Jesus’ love and the blessings of salvation.
- Calls us to examine our lives, confess sin, and find forgiveness.
- Restores our souls as we proclaim His death until He returns.

It’s not just crackers and juice—it’s a moment to pause, reflect, and reconnect with Jesus. I’ve taken communion plenty, but sometimes I rush through it. This made me want to slow down, really think about His sacrifice.

### Why It Matters to Me

Baptism and communion aren’t “weird” when you see their heart. Baptism’s my public yes to Jesus, like telling my nephew (who’s got that silly streak I love) I’m all in for Christ. Communion’s my reset button, reminding me I’m forgiven even when I mess up. The pastor’s challenge: Make prayer your first instinct, not your last resort, when doubts or sin creep in. I’m working on that—praying more with others, like we talked about last week.

What about you? Been baptized, or are doubts holding you back? Does communion hit different when you think about Jesus’ love? Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno](https://x.com/ryanrenno). This series is making me see faith in a new light—more to come!
