title: "Sermon Notes: Jonah Week Three - August 17, 2025"

On August 17, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the Jonah series with Chapter 3. We meet the Ninevites—corrupt, evil, skinning Israelites and hanging their hides on walls, even sacrificing people. Yet God sends Jonah again. Tied to United’s mission of helping people know and follow Jesus, this message unpacked mercy, second chances, and repentance. Here’s what I took away.

### Mercy and Second Chances

The pastor highlighted God’s mercy. Jonah gets another shot after fleeing, just like Moses with his endless chances or Peter, who denied Jesus thrice (Luke 22:54-62) yet got restored to preach the first church message (Acts 2). We think God tires of our failures, but He’s rich in mercy. Jonah delivers a bare-minimum message—“Forty days and Nineveh will be overthrown” (Jonah 3:4)—and the city turns to God. It’s encouraging: our job isn’t to change people but to share the Good News—Jesus took God’s judgment for us.

### The Ninevites’ Turn

The Ninevites believed, sparked by a simple word. The pastor asked: What do you think about Jesus? That’s the conversation starter. When we share, faith grows. The king’s response in Jonah 3:6 is wild—he calls for everyone, even animals, to repent, dressing them in sackcloth. It’s quirky, but it shows desperation. The steps? Come off life’s throne, shed pride, grieve sin, and see its seriousness. Can people accuse you of believing in a holy God? Are you sharing His word?

### Grace Beyond Judgment

Unlike the Ninevites’ uncertainty, we know Jesus’ sacrifice means God won’t hold back love. The pastor said their repentance mirrors ours—sackcloth as discomfort over sin—but Christ’s work secures our hope. It’s not about earning; it’s about receiving.

### My Takeaway

This one hit home. I’ve doubted second chances, thinking I’ve worn God out, but Jonah and Peter show His patience. For me, it’s sharing a simple “What about Jesus?” with someone this week. The king’s animal repentance made me laugh—am I that serious about my sin?

What about you? Where do you need a second chance? Who can you ask about Jesus? Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno](https://x.com/ryanrenno). This series keeps opening my eyes—more to come!
