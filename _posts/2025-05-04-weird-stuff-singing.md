title: "Sermon Notes: Weird Stuff Christians Do - Singing - May 4, 2025"

Today, May 4, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor kicked off a series called “Weird Stuff Christians Do.” First up: singing. Why do we belt out songs about Jesus? From Exodus 15 to Paul and Silas in prison, the Bible shows singing isn’t just noise—it’s a way to celebrate God, strengthen faith, and unite us. Here’s what I took away.

### Singing Celebrates God’s Victory

The pastor started with Exodus 15, the first song in the Bible. After God parted the Red Sea and crushed Pharaoh’s army, Moses and the Israelites sang their hearts out. They praised what God just did—saving them big-time—and who He is: mighty, faithful, unchanging. The pastor said five other Old Testament songs echo this vibe, and it’s the same reason we sing today. Jesus triumphed over sin through the cross and resurrection—that’s good news worth shouting about!

### Singing Fills Us with the Spirit

Ephesians 5:18-19 says, “Be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit.” Want to be a Spirit-filled Christian? Sing. It’s not about hitting the right notes (good news for me); it’s about letting God’s truth sink in. Colossians 3:16 adds that singing teaches us, letting “the message of Christ dwell among you richly.” When we sing, we’re reminding ourselves—and each other—who God is.

### Singing Unites and Strengthens Us

There’s something about hearing our voices together. The pastor said it promotes unity: we’re all labeled “Children of God,” no matter our differences. Singing strengthens our faith too. Take Paul and Silas in Acts 16:25-34. Locked in prison, they sang hymns at midnight. An earthquake hit, chains broke, doors flew open. The jailer, ready to end it all, saw they didn’t run. He asked, “What must I do to be saved?” Their singing sparked a miracle and a conversion. That’s the power of praising through the mess.

### Why It Hits Me

I don't always give it my all and worship God with the honor and glory He deserves. But today’s message flipped that. Singing isn’t just a warm-up act; it’s a way to lean into God’s Spirit, stand with my church family, and trust Jesus more. I’m thinking about those moments I feel stuck, like Paul and Silas in chains. Maybe singing’s my way out—not for an earthquake, but for peace.

What about you? Does singing shift something in you, or is it just “weird Christian stuff”? Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno](https://x.com/ryanrenno). These sermon notes keep stirring me up—let’s keep talking.
