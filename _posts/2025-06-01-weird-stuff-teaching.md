title: "Sermon Notes: Weird Stuff Christians Do - Teaching - June 1, 2025"

On June 1, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the “Weird Stuff Christians Do” series. This week: teaching. Ever notice how Christian sermons can feel weird? We toss around “Christianese” words like “sanctification” or “propitiation” that sound like a foreign language. But teaching’s not just jargon—it’s God speaking through His Word. From 2 Timothy to Luke, here’s why it matters and how to listen well.

### Why Teaching Feels Weird

The pastor kicked off with a laugh: we make teaching weird with our lingo. But there’s a deeper issue—humans push back on authority. Think *Breakfast Club* or *Ferris Bueller’s Day Off*—movies where defying the system is the vibe. In church, we’re called to listen to God’s Word, not roll our eyes like rebellious teens. 2 Timothy 3:14-4:4 lays it out: the Bible is clear, understandable, necessary for salvation, authoritative, and sufficient. It’s not just a book—it’s God’s voice, guiding us to truth.

### The Parable of the Sower: Are We Listening?

Luke 8:8-14, the Parable of the Sower, shows how people hear God’s Word (the “seed”). Some let it get snatched away (verse 12), others receive it but fall away under pressure or distractions (verses 13-14). The good soil? Those who hear and hold fast, producing fruit. The pastor said we’ve got to listen with open hearts, not just nod along. Ezekiel 33:31-32 hit hard: some hear preaching like it’s entertainment, thinking, “I wish so-and-so was here for this.” Instead, we should ask, “What’s God saying to *me*?”

### How to Listen to a Message

The pastor gave four practical tips for engaging with teaching:
1. **Expect God to Speak**: 1 Peter 1:23,25 says God’s Word is living and enduring. Go in ready to hear Him.
2. **Admit God Knows Better**: Let go of pride—God’s wisdom tops ours.
3. **Take Notes for Study**: Jotting stuff down (like I do on my iPhone) helps you dig deeper later.
4. **Do What It Says**: Hearing’s not enough—act on it.

I’m guilty of zoning out or thinking a sermon’s for someone else. These steps are a wake-up call to lean in.

### Communion: God’s Word in the Flesh

We closed with communion, tying it to John 1:1,14: “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.” Jesus, the ultimate Word, gave Himself for us. Taking communion reminds me He’s not just a concept in a sermon—He’s my Savior. It’s a moment to confess, refocus, and let His truth sink in.

### What’s God Saying to Me?

This one’s sticking with me. I can get distracted during teaching, scrolling X or half-listening. But God’s Word is alive, and I want to hear it for myself, not just for “someone else.” The pastor’s question lingers: What’s one thing God’s telling me today? For me, it’s to stop dodging His authority and start doing what He says.

What about you? Do sermons feel like Christianese, or are you hearing God’s voice? What’s one takeaway you’re acting on? Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno](https://x.com/ryanrenno). This series keeps challenging me—more to come!
