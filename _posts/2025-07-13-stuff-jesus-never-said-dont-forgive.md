title: "Sermon Notes: Things Jesus Never Said - you don’t have to forgive - July 13, 2025"

On July 13, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the “Things Jesus Never Said” series. This week: “You don’t have to forgive.” It’s a tempting thought, especially after deep hurt, but Jesus never said it. Tied to United’s mission of helping people know and follow Jesus, this message hit hard with a personal story and scripture. Here’s what I took away.

### A Story of Unforgiveness

The pastor shared a raw moment: a friend of ten years hurt him deeply. He held a grudge for years, too proud to admit his weakness. He knows there are horrible wrongs out there—Jesus’ heart breaks for that pain. Jesus Himself was treated unfairly, betrayed, and crucified, yet He forgives. In Matthew 6:9-15, part of the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus ties our forgiveness to forgiving others: “Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors” (v. 12). The pastor said not forgiving only hurts us—it builds a prison of offense, distancing us from God and others.

### The Cost of Holding On

That grudge changed the pastor. He became guarded, distant, and it strained his relationships. Matthew 18:21-34 drives it home: Peter asks if seven times is enough to forgive, but Jesus says seventy-seven times, telling a parable of a servant forgiven a huge debt who then refuses to forgive a small one. The pastor explained seven symbolizes completeness in Jewish culture, but Jesus pushes beyond limits. Holding offense isn’t just personal—it’s an offense to God.

### Steps to Forgive

The pastor gave five steps to break free:
1. **Admit your sin against God is greater**: Recognize your need for His forgiveness outweighs others’ wrongs.
2. **Ask God to help you forgive**: Lean on His strength.
3. **Ask others to pray with you**: Process with a few trusted friends.
4. **Share your offense**: Approach the person, as Matthew 18:15-20 suggests, if safe and possible.
5. **Forgive them, whether they ask or not**: Release it to God.

### My Takeaway

This one hit close. I’ve nursed grudges, thinking I’m justified, but the pastor’s story showed how it cages you. For me, it’s admitting my own faults first and praying for help to let go—maybe even talking to a friend about it. The question lingers: Is there someone I need to forgive?

What about you? Ever held onto hurt, thinking you don’t have to forgive? Who might God be calling you to release? Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno](https://x.com/ryanrenno). This series keeps pushing me—more to come!
