On April 27, 2025, I was back in church, typing notes into my iPhone as the pastor preached from Luke 24:36-53. He started with a story about Bobby, a family dog who got lost on vacation and—six months later—showed up at home, tail wagging. It set the stage for the sermon’s big idea: we get lost in unbelief, but Jesus brings us home. The disciples did too, even after the resurrection. Here’s what I took away about unbelief and how Jesus flips it.

### Unbelief: Fear, Doubt, Forgetfulness

Luke 24:36-53 picks up post-resurrection. Jesus appears to His disciples, saying, “Peace be with you,” but they’re freaked out, thinking He’s a ghost (verse 37). The pastor broke down how unbelief shows up:

1. **Fear**: The disciples were terrified, despite Jesus predicting His death and resurrection (Matthew 16:21). They’re face-to-face with the risen Jesus, and still spooked.
2. **Doubt**: It’s too good to be true. Even after He shows His hands and feet, they’re slow to believe (verse 41). Sounds like me when God’s promises feel too big.
3. **Forgetfulness**: They forgot Jesus said He’d rise. Unbelief makes us blank on God’s track record.

Unbelief isn’t just a disciple problem—it’s mine too. The pastor said it can make us passive, like we’re stuck, or controlling, trying to fix life ourselves. He pointed to Genesis 16:2, where Sarah, doubting God’s promise, took control with Hagar. Not God’s plan. Unbelief tempts me to shoehorn Jesus into *my* agenda instead of trusting His.

### Where Am I Getting Lost?

The pastor asked, “Where are you struggling with unbelief today?” For me, it’s fear—worrying about work or family stuff instead of leaning on God. Unbelief can make me passive, like I’m waiting for a sign, or pushy, trying to control outcomes. But God rewards those who seek Him (Hebrews 11:6). His Word pulls me out of that fog. Reading Luke 24 reminded me: Jesus showed up, even when the disciples doubted.

### Jesus Transforms Unbelief

Here’s the good news: Jesus doesn’t ditch us in our unbelief. In Luke 24, He gently shifts the disciples’ fear to faith:
- He shows His scars, eats fish, proves He’s real (verses 39-43).
- He opens their minds to the Scriptures, tying His death and resurrection to God’s plan (verses 45-47).
- He promises the Holy Spirit, setting them up for action (verse 49).

The cross wasn’t a glitch—it was the plan. Acts 1:6 shows the disciples still missing it, asking if Jesus will restore Israel’s kingdom now. They wanted a political win, but Jesus had bigger plans: atonement for our sins, freedom from our sin nature that’s been with us since conception.

### Jesus Is Home Base

Bobby the dog found his way home, and Jesus is our home base. He doesn’t promise a pain-free life—no perfect jobs, adoring kids, or bosses singing our praises. But He offers peace and forgiveness. The pastor said we can’t expect Jesus to fit our script; we’ve got to trust His. That hits me hard. I’m learning to let go of control and believe He’s got me, even when life feels wobbly.

What about you? Where’s unbelief tripping you up—fear, doubt, forgetting what God’s done? Let’s keep seeking Him. Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno](https://x.com/ryanrenno) if you’ve got thoughts—these sermons are keeping me on my toes.
