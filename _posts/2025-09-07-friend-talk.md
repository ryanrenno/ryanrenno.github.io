On September 7, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor shifted to a new topic: friendship. With social media booming, we’re not healthier—54% of Americans say no one knows them well. Loneliness hit the headlines in 2023 when the surgeon general called it a mental health crisis. Tied to United’s mission of helping people know and follow Jesus, this message explored how friends shape our faith. Here’s what I took away.

### Friends and Spiritual Health

The pastor asked: How are your friends impacting your spiritual health? And how are you affecting theirs? Proverbs 18:24 says, “A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.” Proverbs 17:17 adds, “A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.” That “sticks” or “cleaves” means a deep bond. Good friends lift us; poor ones drag us down.

### Four Qualities of True Friendship

The pastor outlined four traits:
1. **Consistency** (Proverbs 18:24): Showing up, not just when it’s convenient.
2. **Empathy** (Proverbs 25:20): Feeling with someone, not singing over their pain.
3. **Truth-Telling** (Proverbs 27:6): Faithful wounds from a friend beat flattery.
4. **Loyalty** (1 Samuel 18-20): Like David and Jonathan, standing firm.

Proverbs 27:17 says, “Iron sharpens iron,” pushing us to grow together. Maybe you’ve lost friends over dumb mistakes—Jesus’ transforming power can make you a better one.

### Jesus, the Best Friend

John 15:15-16 calls us friends of Jesus, chosen to bear fruit. He never leaves or forsakes us (Hebrews 13:5). The pastor urged: Pray for a friend with these qualities—or to be one. Start with a simple ask: “God, bring someone to sharpen me.”

### My Takeaway

This one hit home. I’ve felt that 54% loneliness, scrolling instead of connecting. My friends can pull me from faith or toward it—same for me with them. For me, it’s praying for a consistent friend and being one myself. The question lingers: Who’s shaping your soul?
