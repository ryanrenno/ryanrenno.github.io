On August 10, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the Jonah study. We started with a wild fact: Michael Packer was caught in a whale’s mouth for thirty seconds and spit out—echoing Jonah 1:17. This story digs into running from God, His mercy, and prayer’s power. Tied to United’s mission of helping people know and follow Jesus, it brought some raw reflections. Here’s what I took away.

### Fleeing and Falling

The pastor said if we flee from God, we’re on a downward spiral. Sin and rebellion pull us down—doing what we shouldn’t or skipping what we should. Jonah 1:17 shows God appointing a great fish to swallow him, a consequence of his flight. Yet, it’s mercy in disguise. Jonah 2 reveals his prayer from the fish’s belly, near death. The pastor asked: Is prayer our last resort or our first response? It might show where we stand with God.

### Mercy and a Hard Heart

Jonah’s prayer is real and raw—a cry to the real God from the real him. But he’s no Sunday school hero. His hardened heart resisted God’s call to Nineveh. Still, God’s mercy pulls him from the pit. The pastor shared examples: “No cure, but God… financially ruined, but God… marriage over, but God… addicted to screens, but God… down and out, but God…” Everything shifts when God enters the picture. “Aliyah,” Hebrew for “going up” to Jerusalem or God’s words, marks a huge turn.

Ephesians 2:4-5 says, “But God, being rich in mercy… made us alive together with Christ.” Mercy withholds judgment; grace restores. The pit—any despair we can’t escape alone—can be where God meets us.

### The Cry from the Pit

The pastor noted pits we’ve dug with our choices. Jonah’s sin was against God (Jonah 2:8), and realizing his desperation led him to cry out. Verse 9, “Salvation belongs to the Lord,” is the book’s theme—and the Bible’s. Three responses emerge: shrugging it off, believing it half-heartedly, or fully trusting salvation as God’s gift. Jonah’s cry, even late, opened the door to mercy.

### My Takeaway

This one hit hard. I’ve treated prayer like a backup plan, not a lifeline, and my heart’s felt stiff at times. But God’s mercy, even in my pits, shines through. For me, it’s praying first this week—maybe about a struggle I’ve ignored. The question sticks: Is prayer my first response?

What about you? Where are you fleeing from God? What pit needs His mercy now? Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno](https://x.com/ryanrenno). This study keeps digging deeper—more to come!
