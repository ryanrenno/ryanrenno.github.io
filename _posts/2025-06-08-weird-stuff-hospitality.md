title: "Sermon Notes: Weird Stuff Christians Do - Hospitality - June 8, 2025"

On June 8, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as one of our elders preached for the “Weird Stuff Christians Do” series. This week: hospitality. It’s not just hosting a potluck—it’s a commitment to love strangers like family. Sometimes we make it weird, like asking new people to stand up or getting awkward hugs. But God’s idea of hospitality is radical, costly, and life-changing. Here’s what I took away.

### Hospitality: God’s Heart for Strangers

The elder shared a story from a trip to Japan. Eating at a place that only took yen, he had none. A stranger handed him 10,000 yen—no strings attached. That generosity blew him away. It’s what God calls us to in Leviticus 19:34: “Treat the stranger among you as a native-born; love them as yourself.” Hebrews 13:2 adds, “Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for some have entertained angels unaware.” Jesus in Luke 14 and Matthew 5:46 pushes it further: don’t just love your buddies—love the messy, needy, even annoying folks.

The elder told another story: Marcus Luttrell, a Navy SEAL in 2005 Afghanistan, ambushed and left for dead. A man named Gulab took him in, fed him, and got neighbors to protect him from attackers. That’s hospitality with a cost—time, resources, even risk. God’s like that. Ephesians 2:12-19 says we were once strangers, far from God, but Jesus’ sacrifice brought us near. His death was the ultimate act of hospitality, leaving heaven to make us family.

### Why We Make It Weird

We’re tempted to stick with insiders—people like us—because strangers can be messy. I get it; it’s easier to avoid the awkward. But God sees His image in everyone. The elder said biblical hospitality means seeing ourselves in God’s redemptive story—He welcomed us when we were lost. If we dodge the needy or annoying, we’re missing the point.

### How to Live It Out

The elder got practical, sharing ways to practice hospitality:
- **At Sunday Gatherings**: Meet someone new, introduce guests to friends, pray for people, join the hospitality or “new here” team, or invite a stranger to lunch.
- **In Small Groups**: Show up consistently, invite outsiders to join, or lead a group in your home.
- **In Daily Life**: Open your home, get real with neighbors, build your capacity to hang with strangers.

I’m challenged here. I can stick to my comfort zone at church, nodding at familiar faces. But inviting someone new to lunch or getting beyond small talk with a neighbor? That’s where God’s calling me to step up.

### What’s It Cost You?

Hospitality costs something—time, energy, maybe pride. Jesus paid the ultimate price to welcome us, so why not take a risk for others? The elder’s question stuck: “Do you see yourself in God’s redemptive story?” I want to. I’m thinking about one small step—like inviting a coworker over for coffee—to live this out.
