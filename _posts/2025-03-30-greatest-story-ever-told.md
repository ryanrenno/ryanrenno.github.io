Yesterday, March 29, 2025, I sat in church scribbling notes on my iPhone as the pastor unpacked Luke 15:11-32—the Parable of the Prodigal Son. He called it “The Greatest Story Ever Told,” and I get why. It’s about two lost sons, a father’s wild love, and a question: Where are you in this story? Here’s what I took away, cleaned up from my messy taps.

### The Setup: A Shocking Request
The younger son demands his inheritance early—unheard of back then. It’s like saying, “Dad, I wish you were dead; give me my stuff.” And the father? He does it. No other father would. The pastor said this mirrors God’s freedom: He lets us choose to love Him or walk away. The son bolts, squanders it all on “wild living,” and ends up feeding pigs—a shameful low for a Jewish kid, longing to eat their slop.

### The Turn: Coming to His Senses
Luke 15:18-19 hit me: “Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.” He’s broken, ready to grovel. But then, verse 20 flips it: “While he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son.” A Middle Eastern nobleman *running*? That’s wild. Men didn’t run—people ran *to* them. This is God’s heart: chasing us down, kissing us over and over (v. 20), before we can even finish our apology.

### The Father’s Response: Extravagant Love
The son starts his “I’ve sinned” speech, but the father cuts him off: “Quick! Bring the best robe… ring… sandals… fatted calf. Let’s feast!” (vv. 22-24). Meat was a delicacy; slaying the fatted calf was a huge, costly deal. The pastor leaned in here: God doesn’t want us as servants—He wants us as sons and daughters. A.W. Tozer was quoted: “What people think about God shows their faith.” Jesus calls Him Father, majestic yet loving, always seeing our need for Him.

### The Older Brother: Lost in Goodness
Then there’s the older son, fuming outside the party (vv. 25-28). He’s mad: “I’ve slaved for you, never disobeyed, and you never gave me a goat! But this son of yours gets a calf?” He insults the father with “Look!” and humiliates him by not joining the feast. The pastor said this is forced obedience, not a right heart—God won’t force the door open. The father’s reply (v. 31): “My son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.” Yet the older son’s sin is pride—he thinks God owes him.

### The Twist: Both Sons Are Lost
Here’s the kicker: both sons are alienated. The younger wants the father’s wealth through badness; the older through goodness. One’s a rebel, the other’s proud. The pastor asked, “Which are you?” I scribbled: *Be undone by what it costs God to bring you home.* Why the nasty older brother? To point us to the true one—Jesus. He cried, “My God, my God,” on the cross (the only time He didn’t say “Father”), taking the cost to bring us back.

### My Take
This parable and David's message are so impactful and rich with thought provoking insights. I’ve been the younger son, chasing my own way—like building this site on my iPhone just to prove I could. But I’ve also been the older, coasting through life trying to conserve a false image or idol rather in  “being good.” but who I want to be is more like God, the father running to his son! That’s the heart of God! Where am I? I put my faith in Christ and know with self discipline, covenants with Christ, and the work of the Holy Spirit living in me, my idols are being removed and Jesus shines through more and more. I hope you are putting your faith in Him too!

### Your Turn
Which character do you see yourself in—the rebel, the rule-keeper, or maybe the father learning to love like that? Hit me up on [X @ryanrenno] if you’ve got thoughts. I might keep posting these sermon notes—they’re making me think.
