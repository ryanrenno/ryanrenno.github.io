title: "Sermon Notes: Things Jesus Never Said - Money Talks - July 27, 2025"

On July 27, 2025, I was in church, tapping notes into my iPhone as the pastor continued the “Things Jesus Never Said” series. This week: “Money talks.” Jesus talked about money a lot—more than most topics—but not like that. Tied to United’s mission of helping people know and follow Jesus, this message flipped the script on wealth using Luke 16:1-13. Here’s what I took away.

### The Shrewd Manager

The pastor dove into Luke 16:1-13, a tricky parable. A manager, caught skimming from his boss, faces firing. He can’t do manual labor or beg, so he gets clever. With a little time left, he calls his boss’s debtors, slashing what they owe to win their favor. It’s manipulation—self-serving but shrewd. The boss commends his cleverness, not his honesty. Shrewdness means quick, insightful judgment for advantage. The pastor said Jesus isn’t praising dishonesty but urging us to think cleverly about eternity. Time matters more than money—death comes for us all.

### Money and the Kingdom

Jesus’ point? Manage money with kingdom focus. The parable ends, “One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much” (v. 10). If you trust Christ for heaven, you bring nothing—everything’s God’s gift. We’re managers, not owners, entrusted with money, health, property, relationships. Matthew 6:20 says, “Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.” Luke 11:41, 6:40, 14:13-14, and Matthew 10:8 push giving without expecting return—feed the poor, invite the outcast, give freely. The pastor asked: Are you thinking eternally when you handle cash?

### Steps to Shift

The pastor gave two steps:
1. **Do a financial audit**: Check where your money goes.
2. **Give generously and share**: Focus on eternal impact, not temporary gain.

It’s not about owning—it’s about stewarding God’s resources faithfully.

### My Takeaway

This one hit home. I’ve chased stuff, thinking money talks, but Jesus wants my focus on eternity. For me, it’s auditing my budget and giving where it won’t bounce back—like to a local cause. The question lingers: Is my money adding temporary toys or eternal stories?
